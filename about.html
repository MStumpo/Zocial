  		<p>Zocial is a social network based on remotely making a room where people can interact with avatars and short-lived messages, essentially making a virtual party (well that last part just explained the whole thing).</p>
  		<br>
      <p>Basically, imagine the most famous person on Earth is hosting a room. You can join the room, interact with everyone around and get a chance to actually meet and talk to that famous person. And since every user gets their own message space and temporary messages, it fixes the problem of having a big mess and a chat as fast as a dog on Red Bull.</p>
      <p>I'm also thinking of adding a file system so people can share their projects and ideas</p>
      <br>  
  		<p>Think this is just an attempt at making something original but completely stupid and the work of a weirdo who can barely code? Well...</p>
      <p>Also this is still under development (if u haven't noticed) so be patient. I am a one man army and technically I'm an underage and I'm still busy with school, dealing with human beings and other projects.</p>
      <br>
      <p>But hey, I appreciate any attention and I hope this can actually grow as a website and as a community :D</p>

        yeah that's basically it...
